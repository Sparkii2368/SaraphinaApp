Saraphina Progress Timeline
📍 Day 0 — Inception
Scoped Saraphina’s mission and multi‑phase roadmap.

Defined governance principles and the need for provenance, trust anchors, and policy controls.

🛡 Phase 0 — Identity & Trust (Complete, Ahead of Spec)
Identity Manifest: Immutable UUID, version, origin, host/user, platform, git context.

Dual Logging:

runtime.jsonl for operational events

autobiography.jsonl for personal “memories”

CLI Tools: --smoke (heartbeat), --status (identity/memories), --doctor (diagnostics).

Governance & Policy:

policy.yaml v1.2 with structured allow/deny/override rules and provenance requirements.

policy_loader.py + guardrails.py for enforcement with hot‑reload.

Policy integrated into runner.py with logging + health checks.

Provenance validation in ingestion pipeline (ingest_worker.py).

Observability: Phase 0 CLI output shows who Saraphina is and her latest actions.

Testing: Smoke tests confirm core flows.

⚙ Above‑Baseline Extras Before Phase 1
Governance hooks in place before any meta‑cognition work.

Provenance enforcement operational.

Ready hooks for streaming policy decision events into memory (planned).

🚀 Phase 1 — Meta‑Cognition Kick‑off
Objective: Move from self‑description to basic self‑assessment.

New Module: core/insights.py

Reads logs to summarise trends (heartbeat counts, last doctor run, recent autobiography).

Flags simple anomalies (heartbeat gaps > 2 h, repeated errors).

Designed for additive drop‑in — no Phase 0 breakage.

CLI Enhancements:

--status now includes Operational Insights.

New --insights flag dumps full JSON report.

New Module: core/meta_cognition.py

Scores recent events for “confidence” based on type and error/retry presence.

--audit flag runs a 24 h confidence analysis + anomaly check, outputs recommendations.

Logging Symmetry: All new commands log to both runtime and autobiography channels.

Test Loop Proven:

--smoke heartbeat ✅

--doctor diagnostics ✅

--status now narrates trends ✅

--insights dumps structured report ✅

--audit shows per‑event confidence and advice ✅

📅 Right Now
Phase 0 + Phase 1 core pieces are live and functional.

System has visibility into its own recent behavior and can rate itself against a baseline threshold.

No self‑patch or advanced baselines yet — those are Phase 1.1 onward.

🔜 Next Major Steps
Phase 1.1:

Rolling baselines (learn “normal” patterns).

Persistent anomaly tracking.

Auto‑queue self‑patch recommendations when thresholds trip.

Phase 2: Introduce sensory inputs and secure sandboxes.

Beyond: Layer ethical reasoning, swarm logic, temporal reasoning, omni‑sensory channels, and fully resilient autonomy.

If you’d like, I can turn this into a single‑page wallchart — phases along the X‑axis, completed features shaded, in‑progress outlined — so you’ve got a visual status board for Saraphina at a glance. Would you like me to prep that next?
