First licensed on February 17, 1922, it was the first broadcasting station authorized in the state. WOQ was deleted in June 1934, after the Federal Radio Commisson refused to renew its license. History [ edit ] WOQ was founded in 1922 by the Western Rado Company. [ 1 ] The Department of Commerce regulated radio stations in the United States from 1912 until the 1927 formation of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC). Originally there were no restrictions on which radio stations could make broadcasts intended for the general public. However, effective December 1, 1921, a regulation was adopted limiting broadcasting to stations operating under a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on designated wavelengths of 360 meters (833 kHz) for \"entertainment\", and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \"market and weather reports\". [ 2 ] WOQ was first licensed on February 17, 1922, to the Western Radio Company, for operation on both wavelengths.",

[ 7 ] A year later, the station received its final frequency assignment of 1300 kHz, now sharing the frequency with KFH in Wichita, Kansas, [ 8 ] with WOQ assigned 2/7ths of the time. [ 9 ] In December 1931, WOQ's application for license renewal was denied, with the station ordered to shut down and cede its hours to timeshare partner KFH. [ 10 ] Unity appealed this ruling, [ 11 ] but ultimately the station was permanently shut down on June 14, 1934.

Currently most stations west of the Mississippi River have call letters beginning with \"K\". However, prior to the January 1923 establishment of the river as the boundary, call letters beginning with \"W\" were generally assigned to stations east of an irregular line formed by the western state borders from North Dakota south to Texas, with calls beginning with \"K\" going only to stations in states west of that line.

It expressed the desire for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among the Baltic Sea littoral states and was of particular importance in the context of the Cold War.

On the one hand, it was intended to convey a positive image of the GDR abroad; on the other, it emphasized the principle of peaceful coexistence of peoples. The motto was especially prominent during the annually held Ostseewoche (de) ( Baltic Sea Week' ) (1958–1975).

This international festival week included cultural and sporting events and also served as a platform for meetings between enterprises and cooperatives of the Baltic Sea countries. The slogan was also used at Workers' Conferences of the Baltic Sea Countries. The motto remains relevant today, as the Baltic Sea continues to be an area affected by geopolitical tensions and military activities. In contemporary discussions, it is sometimes suggested that the Baltic Sea should once again become a space for cooperation and peaceful coexistence rather than confrontation. An LP entitled Die Ostsee muss ein Meer des Friedens sein! [ 2 ] was released in 1983 by the song group \"Neue Horizonte\", a GDR ensemble from the Volkstheater Rostock (Rostock People's Theatre) focusing on songs with themes of peace and youth from the Baltic countries. Published by the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) on the occasion of a Workers' Conference within the framework of the Ostseewoche, the record also included workers' songs and political songs. Among them was the piece Meinst du, die Russen wollen Krieg? ( Do the Russians Want War? ), based on the text by Yevgeny Yevtushenko .",

Following the establishment of the Kurdistan Region in the 1990s, efforts were made to centralize the command structure, leading to the eventual formation of the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs as part of the KRG institutions. [ 2 ] Structure [ edit ] The ministry commands several brigades and administrative units, though parts of the Peshmerga remain aligned with the region’s main political parties. It plays a central role in unifying and professionalizing the force within the wider framework of Kurdistan’s security institutions.

[ 1 ] Java's priority has been to combat overfishing in the Tarapoto Lakes, protect their river fauna, and ensure food sovereignty for their indigenous communities. After 20 years of working with indigenous authorities, institutions, and organizations, Java secured fishing agreements that respect the wetlands of the lakes and prohibit the use of large nets. Together with women from the 22 indigenous communities of the territory, she has monitored and supervised fishing to restore and conserve Amazonian ecosystems through ancestral indigenous knowledge. They have also managed to control illegal fishing . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] All this community work led to the designation of the Tarapoto Lakes wetlands complex as a Ramsar site .",

Accordingly, Oberstein—there as an engineer—suggested to the musicians that he record their jamming. [ 6 ] Some have suggested that the idea for A Jam Session at Victor originated in part when Waller and Berigan were paired together on an episode of the WABC and CBS network radio series Saturday Night Swing Club , broadcast live from New York City on January 16, 1937. Dorsey and McDonough were also guests on the show at other points.",

[ 1 ] Gilbert M. Erskine of The Second Line considers \"Blues\" to be \"a classic blues instrumental\" comparable to Armstrong's \"Knockin' a Jug\". He invoked a concept found in systems of artistic theory, namely \"the concept of an idea perceived and lying dormant in the unconscious intellect, where it is refined, reworked, before finding ultimate expression\", to praise the \"stunningly effective\" tremolo–press roll work of McDonough and Wettling during Waller's chorus, further praising the \"absolutely superb\" effect of implied rhythm later in the track. [ 2 ] Berigan and Dosey continued a professional relationship, although their mutual respect was usually only musical rather than also personal. [ 6 ] Oscar Moore borrowed from McDonough's final solo on \"Honeysuckle Rose\" for one of Nat \"King\" Cole 's recordings of the composition, whereas George Barnes remembered it almost note-for-note even after a gap of 35 years.

Retrospective commentators have focused on the playing of the individuals, with some considering the jam session among the best recorded work of several of its contributors. Background and recording [ edit ] As jazz pianist Fats Waller returned to his native New York City in March 1937 to play at the Apollo Theater , thus concluding his latest tour, Eli Oberstein , recording director at Waller's label Victor , noticed that several of the label's other jazz artists were in New York at that moment, namely Tommy Dorsey , Bunny Berigan , Dick McDonough and George Wettling . [ 1 ] Deciding to take advantage of the coincidence, Oberstein arranged an authentic jam session for the musicians, with the results to be released on a Victor record. [ 1 ] Numerous phone calls were necessary to bring the musicians together. Drummer George Watling later said that Berrigan and Dorsey were on bad terms with each other, their shared animosity intense enough for the other musicians to initially believe neither would turn up for the session. To this end, Oberstein convinced the participants that the jam session would be musically and financially beneficiary to each of them.",

It's still important and you do need things like that to happen. People need to know that what you're doing is there and a big single is the way to spread the word.\" [ 4 ] Promotion [ edit ] A music video was filmed to promote the single. Armatrading also performed the song on the British TV show Wogan , which was broadcast on 11 May 1992. [ 5 ] Critical reception [ edit ] Upon its release as a single, Jim Whiteford of the Dundee Evening Telegraph wrote, \"Love her or hate her, you cannot ignore Joan Armatradinig or her new single 'Wrapped Around Her', which appears a few weeks before her new album. Fairly tasty for her fans!\" [ 6 ] Jim Lawn of the Paisley Daily Express commented that \"hopefully [it will be] the hit it deserves to be\".

[ 2 ] History [ edit ] See also: History of the Peshmerga The Peshmerga have their roots in Kurdish armed movements of the 20th century, gradually evolving from partisan militias into a regional military force. Following the establishment of the Kurdistan Region in the 1990s, efforts were made to centralize the command structure, leading to the eventual formation of the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs as part of the KRG institutions. [ 3 ] Structure [ edit ] The ministry commands several brigades and administrative units, though parts of the Peshmerga remain aligned with the region’s main political parties. It plays a central role in unifying and professionalizing the force within the wider framework of Kurdistan’s security institutions. [ 4 ] Reform efforts [ edit ] Since the war against the Islamic State (ISIS) , reform has been a priority for the ministry.",

The last time scientists saw the frog was in 1999, so they think they might all be dead now. They say there are no more than 249 adult frogs alive at a time. Human beings change the places where the frog lives by building dams for electricity , farms, and towns and by cutting down trees to get wood to build with . Scientists believe the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might kill this frog too because it has killed other frogs in Telmatobius .
