Progress Recap — From Day 1 to Now
Early Governance & Trust Foundations
Policy Upgrade – policy.yaml bumped to v1.2

Now has structured allow/deny/override rules, decision codes, provenance requirements, tags, and a defined logging format.

✅ Done — committed and tagged.

Policy Loader + Enforcer – policy_loader.py, guardrails.py

Central, hot‑reloadable source of truth for policy.

Uses pattern matching to gate seeds and actions; returns decision codes.

✅ Done.

Runner Integration – runner.py

Policy gate sits in the execution loop; logs which policy version was active.

Health checks include a “policy sanity” step.

✅ Done (future: emit policy events into memory).

Provenance Validation – ingest_worker.py

Enforces v1.2 provenance rules for all incoming data; blocks or warns as configured.

Decisions exposed in metrics.

✅ Done.

Policy Events into Memory – memory_engine.py

Pending — would append allow/deny events to episodic memory streams for long‑term recall.

Visual Policy Dashboard – streamlit_app.py

Pending — planned panel showing recent policy decisions, counts, top blocked domains, and current policy version.

Phase 0 — Identity & Trust ✅ Complete
What’s in place:

core/identity.py – Manifest with app info, UUID, provenance, git/env context.

core/autobiography.py – Append‑only journal of key events.

Dual logging – logs/runtime.jsonl + logs/autobiography.jsonl.

CLI – --smoke, --status, --doctor all functional and log to both channels.

Governance hooks – Policy system already in place and active.

Observability – Status shows identity and recent memories.

Guarantee – Additive changes made without breaking baseline features.

Above‑baseline extras:

Policy v1.2 + hot‑reload enforcement done before Phase 1.

Provenance validation embedded in ingestion pipeline early.

Solid test harness (tests/smoke_phase0.py).

Current Roadmap (Revised with This Work)
Phase	Focus	Notable Features
0	Identity & Trust ✅	Manifest, autobiography, dual logging, policy/provenance enforcement
1	Meta‑Cognition & Growth	Insights, confidence scoring, audit triggers, self‑patch planning
2	Multi‑Modal Perception	Vision, voice, secure code sandbox
3	Ethical Alignment & Cyber Defense	Ethical proofs, threat intel ingestion, EDR + rollback
4	Collective Intelligence & Swarm	Multi‑agent orchestration, encrypted peer sync, hypergraph store
5	Temporal Mechanics	Time‑aware reasoning, non‑linear memory
6	Omni‑Sensory Augmentation	Tactile/scent synthesis, AR/VR interfaces
7	Ultimate Interfaces	Neural link stubs, ultra‑low‑latency APIs
8	Learning Autonomy	Self‑supervised loops, skill registry
9	Resilient Autonomy	Code introspection, self‑debugging, automated rollback
10	Global Co‑Evolution	Federated learning, global policy negotiation
Verdict
Phase 0 isn’t just done, it’s ahead of spec thanks to early governance and provenance work.

Raw materials for Phase 1 (logs, policy hooks, observability) are already in place.

The next leap will be about turning awareness into assessment and action — confidence metrics, anomaly baselines, and triggers that feed self‑patch planning.
